Of compendia scribendi, as distinct from abridged words, the Iatiu os Ood. Benae has but
few. At the end of a lina ‘over the laet letter stands for rn; iu Oodd. Palatinus and claromontanus
the line stands for m or a indifferently: a single point (usually the upper point, but sometimes
the middle) indicates a termination omitted, e. g. hominib· Matth. x. 33, ossib a'hid. xxiii. 27,
milatiaq· Acta xiii 19. Occasionally an unfiuished word has not suclr point, apparently through

Some grounds sor believing that this manuscript was written iu the region where it was
eventually found in the sixteenth ceutrny were stated in the last chapter (p. xxxi): the following
philological reasons, so lar as they go, would suggest the same conclusion of its Gallie origin

(1)· 16 addition to the nuclamical and indeed ungrammatical use of de to express the genitive
in Acte ii 30 , xx. 17 (see p. xl), we find in the style of d distinct traces of the employmcnt
of haheo asan auxiliary verb, which is well known to be a notable characteristic of the modern
laugnages of Western Europe (of the French ae much as any) aa distinguished from the latin
whence most os them sprung. Iu Mark xiv. 27 unanimous (i. e. -θε) 16 rendered maritari
iubetis by d, but scandulaca potiemini by ac, scandelicabimini by s and the Vulgata Habeo is
thus used three times to render μελλω, Luke x. 1, xix. 4, Acts i. 6, although the Greek word
is translated by incipio 25 times (sometimes very awkwardly), 15 times by the future participle,

three times in other ways (Mark xiii 4, Acte xvi. 27, xxi. 37).
Two or three peculiar words, which better scholare may perhaps heraalter add to, point to

the same conclusion as regards the nationality of the translator. Schola (Μ’. Proleg. p. xxxix')
