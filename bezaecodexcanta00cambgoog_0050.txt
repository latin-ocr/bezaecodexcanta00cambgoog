it probably lay before the writer while engaged on his task3 even d was familiar with it, whether
he retained it in memor-y (e. g. quos constituamus u. 3), or only referred to it occasionally: henos
chss more of the characteristic diction of the Vulgata than d (e g. 00. 1 ; 43 ὅ fira3 12 fica).
Both d and s aimed at representing the peculiarities of their respective Greek texts, which the
Vulgata was obviously unable to accomplish far them3 ande frequently quits his model in the
attempt to render the Greek more strictly and literally, in the same spirit as we have observed with
regard to Ood. Besae, though not carried out 00 the same plan. Thus iu a. 1 the translator essems

for dispiciuntur (p. xxxiv). Of the various readings found in d and e throughout Acts vi. we
will speak iu the next Ghapter: but there seems nothing in the diction of d as here contrasted
with the only other· two forms of the ancient Latin extant in this portion of Scriptura ivhich
would lead us to modify the judgement arrived at on fuller evidence in the case of Luke xxiv 3
namely, that the parallel translation in Gadex Beue was made directly from its Greek or from
a text almost coinciding with it, by ane who had full acquaintance with (though he mede ua formal
use of) the labours of his predecessore, especially the revision executed by J erome abouta century
before his time.

Though on the whole disposed to advocate this view, as best satisfying the facts of the
case, ue must not forget that it is sucumbered with one considerable difficulty 3 hemely, that
the Greek and Latin texts in the parallel columns of Codex Besae differ from each other, as
regards tho readings they follow, in little less than two thousand places As the result of a
minute examinatiou of the whole manuscript, underteken with a view to this single point,

·it may be stated that the Iatin (without taking account of its own clerioal errore) is at
varianas with the Greek in 1919 instances (in S. Matthew 251, S. John 229, S. Luke 428,

S. Mark 380, Acts 631), being less than the whole number of places (1981)Ι 10 which the
Greek Godd. FG of S. Paul (which 00 one doubts to be separate transcripta from the same
prototypa) differ in but the first thirteen of the Paulino Epistles And it must be added
fur-thermum that the vast majority of these 1919 divergencies relate to matters so insignifioant
that they would be utterly overlooked except hy a reader who uas narrowly watching for them.
