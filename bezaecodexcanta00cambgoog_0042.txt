We can say little about Scholz’s statement, that the native country 01 1110 manuscript may be
regarded as 110 Sonth of France, by reason of its resemblance in style of writing to the nncial lectionary
of the Coepels Erat 60, whose subscription shews 1101 11 was copied an. 1022 “in oestro de Colonia”
for 110 monastery of S. Denys (Schola, N. T. Proleg. 1. pp. xl 5 ciii). Itis hard to conceive that thera
can be any striking likeness between codices which differ in age by full 500 years, though there is
certainly some affinity between their respective texts ; yet the very fact theta Greek Lectionary
should be written for a French convent in 110 01000011 century adds one more link 10 110 chain of
evidence that 110 Churches 01 Gaul end Asia maintained 100 many ages the intercourse commenced by
Pothinus and his missionaries about aa. 170, and makes it quite oredible that Oriental proper lassans,
as well es 110 00100101 liturgy (Palmer, 001910. Isitury. 1. p. 153, 200 edit), were long used in some 01
110 monasterias of those regions: the lituryy, as 00 know, survived till Pepin's time. Hence we
need not transfer our manuscript 1ο Graece in order to account for 110 liturgical notes scattered
throughout its margin in the course 01 110 eighth and three following centurias, or refer them with
Beaa to 110 work “indocti cujusdam Graeci aalays? (aas his letter, supra p. vi). Τ10 very ortho-
graphy 01 11000 notices savours of a Celtic origin (000 p. xxvii, 0010 1) ; and the ouly three Saints'
Days whose proper lessons are marked 000 just such as would be specially regarded in the West at
their respective dates, via the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin (Aug. 15) hya hand of 110 tenth
eentnry (Μ, Fol. 229 b), the Festivals of S. Georgo and S. Dionysius the areopagita, the patron saints
01 England and 1100000, inserted as 1010 as the twellth (by Ο, Foll 102 0 ; 488 b)¹. Thus all outward
appearances point 10 Gaul as the native country 01 Codex Besae (00 shall notice internal indicatione
of the same fact in Chapter 111), nor is there any valid reason for thinking that it ever left that
country till it was carried into Italy in 1546 (000 p. viii).

Tne origin aud character of the 10110 version standing parallel to the Greek text of
Codex Besae, and known to critice by 110 name of d, involves questions 01 considerable diffi-
