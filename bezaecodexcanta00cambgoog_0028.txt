carry it up into a curve, more or less flourishcd. Oodd. Bezee and claromontanus again conspire
with Ood. Augiensis of the ninth century in making] with a simple perpendicular line very slightly
turned up in a fine stroke at bottom: the rest have a strong vertical line, sometimes a little carrad,
though seldom so long as the perpendiculer memben FPQR descend below the line in most of
these copies (not however FR in that of Vercellae, or PR in that of Verona, or R in the Brixiae
and Olaromontane, but even the angulas A in Cod. Palatinus), though our codex alone has the line
strokea running to the left et the bottom of these letters. On the whole, however, the impressicn
conveyed by a careful comparison of them all would suggest the notion that the nice discrimination of
their dates by means of the style of writing is not sc easy or so certain in regard to latin manuscripts
of the fourth to the sixth centurias as with Greek documenta of the same age (see also Tischendorf,
Ocd. Palatia. Prolegom. p. xv).

The sister bilingue] codd. Bezae and claromontanus alfard the earliest, aud, in fact, the two
chief extant examples for the New Testament, of manuscripts divided inte verses, or στίχοι, the
Iatin lines being intended tc follow the Greek, and only differing from them by accident. It
mrmt bc coneeded that this division, as applied to the books of Hcly Scriptura, prevailed much
earlier then has been genemlly supposed. Not only do Athanasius [d. 373], Gregory Nysaea
[d. 396], Epiphanius [d. 403] end Chrysostom [d. 407] inform us that in their time the book
of Psalms was already divided into στίχοι, while «lemme [d. saul] testifica the same for the book
of Isaiah (Suicer, Thesaurus Ecclesiast. Τ. 11. p. 1033), but Origen also [d. 254] speaks of the second
arrd third Epistles of S. John as both of thern not exceeding one hundred στίχοι, of S. Paul’s
Epistles as consisting of few, S. J ohn’s first Epistle of very few (Euseb. Ilia. Eccl. L. vl. c 25),
while Eustathius of Antioch in the fomth century reckons 135 such στίχοι from John viii. 59
ιο x. 31¹. The student, indeed, may see this for himself in regard lo the poetical books of the
0.'r.‚ as preserved in the two great reliques of the fourth centary, Oodd. Vaticanus and Sinai·
ticus 5 wherein, according to the true principles¹ of Hebrew poetry, the verses donet correspond
in metra or in the quantity of syllables, but in the parellelism or mutual relation subsisting between
the several members of the same sentence or staura. In Codex Bezae, this orderly and system·
atie arrangement, which must have been designed by those who first distributed into στίχοι the
sacred text of the Gospels aud the Acts, hes to a certain extent been disturbed end broken up,
in some places much more than in others. Now since it will appear clearly berea-fler thet the
manuscript es it stands-at present was closely and exactly copied from another, perhaps almost
contemporary to itsclf, similarly divided in respect of στίχοι though not similarly paged (below
p. xxiii), it will follow that the model from which this latter was taken is older still, (lating perhaps ²
aa early as or earlier than the time of Origen. The reeder will not doubt that the ancient στίχοι
were being gradually dissolvet in course of time by successive transcribere, if he pays any attention
to their actual condition in Oodex Besae In the first Gospel, although many of the clausas are¹
not balanced in the strict and regular· fashion which would have satisfied the laws of parallelism
as leid down by Bp. Jebb (eg. Matth. vi.1; ix. 17; xi. 213 xiii. 40; xvi. 18; xxvi. 51 ὥσ),
though a few lines end in γαρ (iv. 103 vi. 73 xvii. 15), or iu δε (xx. 2), or even in the article
(vi 63 xiv. 353 xia. 1), yet the close of each στίχος usually coincides with some slight pause in
the sensa With the first page of S. John the dissolutior of the verses becomes much more
marked (e. g. i. 43 10; 13), and though only one line (i. 16) ends with the article before cb. vi. 32,
yet such irregularity occurs no less thau 4¹8 times from thet place to the end of the Gospel, while in the
