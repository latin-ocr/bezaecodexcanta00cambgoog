Ture invaluable manuscript ferrus a quarto volume, teu inchee high by eight broad, whose
margin, though still ample, has been cut down, at lecet in parte, by the biuder. Its material is
excellent sellum, perhaps not quite eo fine and thiu ae that of the Codices Olaromontauus (Paul D),
vercellensis (Evan. a), and a few others, but for the most part in good condition3 although some of
the leaves aue falling into holes, while iu others the ink has much worn off, or has been waehed away
or read off on the opposite page through damp, especially ou the rougher or outer side os the animal'e
skiu. In some places the mischief hae been aggravated by the applicatiou of a chemical mixture for
the purpose of restoring the laded writing: but, ou the whole, every alternate open leaf, as presentiug
the smooth or iuner eide of the vellum‚ie iu fair preservatum some being as clear and fresh as it'
written yesterday. Assirming that Codex Besae ended with the Acts of the Apostles, it must
have originally consisted of 534 leaves, distributed into 67 quires or quaternione ot' four sheets or
eight leaves each, only that the asch was accidentally made up of only three sheets or six leaves,
the ianermost sheet οἰ the four being lest out: the numeral signaturcs oi the quires, written·
primd mona, were set at the foot of the last page of each, but eo low down that they were often
cut away iu part or wholly hythe biuder3 we have carefully noted ull that remeius of them (see
pp. 15, 80 ; 105 ιο). Os these 534 leaves there are lost the first two and eeventh of the first
quire, all the eight of the third, fourteenth, twenty-second, and fifty-serenth quires 3 all aiter the ,
fifth leaf of the forty-fourth ιο ιιο eud of the fifty-second quire, the first and serenth leaves of 1
the sixty-sourth quire3 the whole of quires sixty-five ιο sixty·seven¹: thus after thalassus 128
leaves, only 406 survive (about twelve of them being more or less mutilated)‚ besides uine added
by a much later haud to supply some of the defecta, whereof we may better spesk hereafter. The
manuscript once contained the four Goepels iu their usual Western order (SS. Matthew, John, Lulre,
