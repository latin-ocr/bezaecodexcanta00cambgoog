at least with an obiter dictum of Tischendorf While secking to account for the absence of
the larger chaptere (κεφάλαια 0103010) from (iod. Bezae, although they ere found in copies of
as early or an earlier date, 10 says “excipiendus tamen est D codex Graecus et Latinus 00010-
11131011010, quod inde explicandum videtur, quia Italus ejusdem codicis textus, a quo 13000111 &cecum
0000011000011001 001, nibil ejusmodi praebuit'' (cod. Sinas't. Proleg. p. xxxii, 001 2, edit. min).
By “Italus ejusdem codicis textus” our version 11101101 needs bc meant, yet we hold it certain
that 00 far from the Greek text being dependent on or derived from it, the Latin version is
little better then a 01000 end often servile rendering of the actually existiug Greek.
