It is now 511110 50 enumerate the instances in which 0011011 Β1100 has been employed by scholare
for critical purposea (1) We hesitate not to assign the 11115 place on the list 50 11011015 Stephana
and his third edition of the Greek New Testament 1550. The identity 01 (lodex Bezae with β’ in
Stephens' margin ought never to have been doubted by any 0110 who had availed himself 01 the
means at our disposal 101 testing that editor's accuraey. His principal authority α’ was the Complu-
tensian Polyglott, a printed bools in high reputa and readily accessible After deducting mere 011010,
¹ itacisms, and such like, out cf tha 2300 places wherein it differs from his own printed text, Stephane
cites α’ correctly only 554 times, and falsely 56 times, so that 111010 511111 one ease in ten involves a
mistake, while three variatione ont 01 four are utterly neglected. 15 is not likely that his representa-
tion of a document he had not seen, and only heard 01 from the repert of another, would be more
exact than that of a well-known published volume: yet after comparing both his α’ and β’ with their
respective prototypon, we 111 enabled to declara that the readings 010011.1),11 being very striking and ·
peculiar, are 1110115110110101115111111111111111111101 the two. Except that Stephana cites β in Matth
xxvii. 3 rapodone (where nearly the whole leaf has perished), in manifest error for his η’ 01 (lodex L
(Ρ1111,62); again in 1 ohn xix. 6, where, though Ood. D is defective in the original 1111111, the later scribe
who supplied the hiatus 015001110011011101110111011050115011 (σταυρωσον 011111ρο001 curav) ς and again
in Acts 111 31, also wanting 111000. D, where the whole reading belongs to his δ’ (Coe Act. 5, Paris,
106) which 11001100511 alleged 101· η μεν ουν εκκλησια, although the aequal ειχεν ειρηνην οικοδομουμενη...
πορευομενη....ιπληθυνετο is wrongly referred 50 yth-with these slight exceptions Stephene never
employa his authority β’ in 511010 many passages wherein the leaves 01 0011. D have been lost, though
, he perpetually quotes it up 50 the very 111110 where the hiatus begins, and recnrs 50 15 immediately
after the text by tha first hand is resumed. After a careful analysis of all tha variatione imputed

neglected) they amount 50 380 in all the parts written by the original scribe 01 Codex Bezae¹:

Acts vi. 10 3 xx. 18) ; while β’ quite differs from 0011. D in 25 places, or less than one 1111101111,
whereas we have seen that Stephens' α’ varied 110111 its printed original once in ten times³. Most 01
these 25 passages have been previously examined by Wetstein (N. T. Proleg. 1. pp. 36-38), aad, reganl
