fragment of Fol. 96 which contained Matth. xxvi. ιιι-11111111 Latin, xxvii 2-1161111, though
overlooked by Kipling, is bound up between Foll. 89 aud 90, and its contente will be found below
in their proper plaee; we have also recovered irorn the previous collatione nearly all the readings
of the last ten or eleven lines of Fol. 504 (Actsnxxi. 7-10Laua 16-18 Greek), which though
evidently damaged when Whitgilt’s copy was made (sec p. xi), were not cut off from the rest of
the leaf till aiter Dickinscn's time (acc p. xii). Our only difficulty is with the Catholic Epiatles,
which could hardly heve covered more than fifty of the missing sixty·six¹ leaves between the end of
S. Mark and the beginning of the Acts, even though we suppose that S. J ude was inserted, as iu some
catalogues, otherwise than in the last place. Since the superfluous sixteen leaves would suffice
neither ior the Epistle ιο the Hebrews, nor for the Apocalypse, nor for any other book at all likely
to occur in such a position, but would take up cuaeth! two quires, we venture to suggest that the
original penman may have miscounted bis quires by two at some place iu the portion that is loet;
just aa we know that one of two later scribes must heve done in God. Sinaitious, ineamuoh as they
differ by unity in 'numbering the quires irom the eommeneement os S. Paul's Epistles (erat. 82 or
81) down ιο the end of the manuscript.

Like its younger contemporary the cod. claromontanus (Paul. D), Godrx Besae has the Greek

· text in the post of honour on the left hand page of each open leal‘, the Latin version on the right

hand or second page: in this respect differing from the other bi-lingual copies, Godd. Iaudianus
(Act E) and Augiensia (Paul. F), which exhibit the Latin on the len, the Greek on the right, in two
parallel columns of the same page, ss also does God. sangermanensis (Paul. Ε) only with the Greek
ou the lest. Both the Greek and Latin oi God. che arc written in bold, regular, and elegant unciel
characters with the words undivided, arranged not as most others, iulium containing nearly the same
number of letters, but in verses or στίχοι determined bytho sense, the Greek and Latin closely cor·¹
responding with each other. Evcry page exhibite thirty-three such verses or lines¹ (kept regular by
the usual means oi a bodkin-ocua—end a ruler)‚ except at the end ol a boolr, when the scribe
breaks off to fill up the rest of each page with simple arabesque ornaments and a brief subscription,
partly written and partly adorned with bright red colours, hut in a style not more elaborate thau is
seen in corresponding parts oi Codd. Sinaiticus and Alexandrinus Such an open leaf at the end of
S. John's Gospel (rou. 181 h, 182 a: infra p. 159) isrepresented in our first two saceimile peges
(Platea I, II), to which the render will plenae ιο make frequent reference as he examines our
statements throughout the present chapter. In the titles and subscriptione of the several books
the words appear separated, and stendeucy to the same practice may be observed here and there in
the body oi the Latin version itself (e. g. Fol. 138 a.)⁸. The first three lines of each book whose
beginniugis extant, are iu the rich red or vermillion paint we bave just mentioued, still persectly
bright and fresh, while the ink of the rest of the manuscript is on the smooth side oi the vellum ol
the yellowish brown colour which (as well as the red) our Facaiou'lc tries ιο imitate, but of a darker or
more asby hue where the euriaco is roughor, or the leaf otherwise iu worse condition: so precarious is
any argument that may be drawn from mere differente in the shade of ink as to change in the hand

which used it.
