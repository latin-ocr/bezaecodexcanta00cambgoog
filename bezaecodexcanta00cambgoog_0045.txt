(δ) The same inference, so far as regards the fact of the independsnt origin of the Greek
text, at least 01 110 Latin which stands on 110 opposite page in Codex Besae, may be drawn
from those places where the present Latin differs from the Greek in respect to a variation which

,could hare arisen only in tlre Latin. This process, applied by Wetstein 10 110 case of the
Valesian readings (N. Τ. Proleg. Vol. 1 p. 60) has settled the question 00 10 their history and

Il. We shall 1001 investigate 110 next branch 01 1110 11001100100-110 10101100 which the
Latin version of Codex Besae bears 10 the old version 01 110 Western Ohurch, 001 10 110 Vulgata
revision 01 11 01000101 by S. Jerome—if we select a passage 01 00100 length, extant in all 110
principal manuscripts 01 theold Latin, rich in peeuliar and idiomatis expressions, and little liable
to be corrupted from the synoptic Gospels (Lulre xxiv. 1-24),· wherein we may compare the
translation found in our Codex (d 01 110 critical editions) with that 01 110 Vercelli (0), Verona (b),

weighs iar 100 much with some critico, and 10 peculimly

¹ ’110 following 1011000 readings also, the Latin 001·-
sion being quite correct, could only have originated in
the Greek: e. g. Matth. xi. 3 εργαζυμενοσ 101· ερχομενοσ

‘ (renis, d); John siv. 01 aspersae for εμφανισω (muudum,

d); Lulre ii. ¹3 αιτονντων ior 00000000 (laudantes, d);
itid. 11. 00 err apso for 000000 (ΤΙ for ll: 0100000, d);
xiv. 06 receti for μεισει (odit, d); Acts iv. 09 cyneo for
arrhae (ΓΙ 101· 111; minacior, d); idid. v. 4 μεσω 101· με·
ror (morrena, d). Gredncr (Beitrdge, 1. p. 463), besides
several oi the 010νο exemplos, also cites John 1. 39 0000·

We demonstrated above (p. xxiii), by noting eertain errors
01 110 transcribet, that the Latin 0011 now stands was
taken from another Latin copy, similarly divided in re·
spect to erlxot: we have now further and independeut
proof that the version (d) was not made direct from the
actually existing Greek (D), but from some earlier text,
almost though not quite the same, in which such varia·
110110 as τελωνων, repercussos, esperare 110. had notas
yet sprung up.

¹ M r Field 100 employed this method fur the happy clu
cidation 01 that old pussle in Barnabas c. 3, where the au·
cient Latin version has “sicut dicit filius Dei resistamus
omni iniquitati et odio habeamus:’' a saying no where

else imputed to 110 Lord. The Greek in cod. Sinaiticns
stands 00 0000010101οἩ κ. τ. h: ricrd deret siliis Dei.
