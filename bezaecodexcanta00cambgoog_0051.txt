in a Matthew 78, 11 8151117211 S. Luke 13⁵, in S. Mark the higher proportion ef 1463
in the Acts (whose primitive text both Latin and Greek was left in a very rude condition,
and has been largely corrected in later times) they amount to as many as 285 ; yet even these
ere of no great moment, many the¹ manifest result 51 mere negligencc, while in some 51 the
more considerable our translator d adopts the very expression of the Vulgata Latin: eg. Acts
i. 4 (with em. suld); ii. 3 3 iv. 14 (without ποιησαι η, but yet latebant in d, poterant Vulg.);
v. 81111. 7; xv. 373 xvii. ll; xviii. 2; xix. 23.

ΙΙΙ. We must 1511 stete our reasons for believing that the Latin translator executed his
werkin some remote province, where the lenguage‚ though still eernaadar, had far progressed 11
its decline; most probably in Gaul, about the time of the Frankieh invasion, and in the dialect
then employed in general speech (fer the matie Latin was commonly spoken in Seuthem Gaul
up to the close of the seventh century¹), rather than in that more correct manner which Church
writers like S. Gregory of Teura ¹would of course preserve even at a later period Its provincial
character aad growing corruption are abundantly manifested in the grues violatione of gmmmaticel
propriety which prevail throughout every portion, 15 1 fer greater extent than 11 found 11 any
other Old Latin translation 51 Scriptura. Such especially are those perpetual errore in the govern-
ment of prepositions, of which, however, we 111111111111111111111111110511Ρ111111111(ε)’ and some

S. Matthew, 8 times in S. John, on1y5 times in S. Luke, 32 11 S. Mark, 28 in the Acta
This unequal distribution of the most noteble peculiarities 11 the style arrd grammatical con-
struction we have had occasion to point out before. Tho proposition de, marserei-,is employed at
least twice in the Acts 11 1 substitute for the genitive: thus de praecordia (τησ naphtae) ii. 30;
de eccleciam (τησ εκκλησιασ) xx. 17, look more like French than Latin: though ea 11 x. 255
xvii. 12 ; xxi. 39 (with yenit.) is 51 ceurae correct enough, though not indispensabla
