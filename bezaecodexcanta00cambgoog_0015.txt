explicit statement prefixed to the book (perhaps 01 an earlier period) in his own cramped hand, and
still preserved there together with his original letter: “ Fst hoc exemplar venerandae vetustatis 011
Graecia, ut apparet ex barbaris graecis gbusdam ad marginem adscriptis, olim exportatum, et in
Sancti Irenaoi monasterio, Lugduni, ad [ad 0100] ite ut hic cernitur, mutilatum, 110010Ἰ ibi in pulvere

withheld in his public letter yet by no means studionsly 0000001011, 11 evinces strange ignor-anco both

01 theman and 01 his evil times to suppose-that Beza received this most praeiens document asa *

present 1101111110 hands 01 the Lyonese monks‚ under circumstances which would have enabled him to
leam whatever they might know 01 110 history¹. Certainly his own words “ 0001110,” “repertum''
and “erutum'' (N. 11,1582, Ρ1001), suggest 00 idea 010 gift, and the 1001 object the brotherhood
01 S. Irenaeus would have selected for euch doubtful liberality would have been the ablest champion

of their enemies in the Colloquy at Poissy (Sept. 1561), who was then actually serving as Chaplain ,

and Counsellor 01 the Huguenot army in the campaign which ended with the battle 01 Dreux

(19 December, 1562). Lyons, it must be remembered, was sacked in this very year 1562, κ0110010 1

Council 01 Τ1001 10 1546 “0 very ancient Greek manimcript⁴,’' confirming the 10110 reading “sic ¹
eum volo” in John xxi. 22, which Cod. D, alone 01 011 known authorities, might appear 10 do: when
, his end was served, the Bishop would 01000100 restore it to his neighbours, the monks 01 S. Irenaens,
11010 whom he bad horrowed it. This view is strongly confirmed by the fact that about the year
1546, when Robert Stephens was collecting materiale 101 his critical editions 01 the Greek Testament‚
numerous extracta 110111 0 document (by him called (1) which we shall soon prove 10 have been none
