01 the liturgical and other matter set hy various hands iu the margin 01 this document, will be
found rather curicus in 1111111111 may tend to throw some light 01 the disputed question 01 the
region iu which Codex Bezae was written, and of the country 11 which it was preserved prior
to the sixteeuth century. of these marginal notes we subjoin Facsimilc specimens (Plate 111, Nos.
11, 12, 14, 15), end 1 1111 list at the end 01 the Adnotutiones (pp. 418-452).

(1) The text as it came 11011 the original scribe is represented only so far as 1111 by the editor
with his own eyes In 1 few places (a. g. 1011. 361 1. 27, 37 a l. 23, tta l. 29, 7 90 1. 7, and 01
Fol. 510) letters have been omitted which Kipling inserted, and which were probably visible enough
seventy years ago, in many others (1111011. 261. 1, 3211. 2, 35111. 24-27, 9011. 1-5), where
mere fragments 01 letters and words survive, which yet can be discerned without any doubt,
they 111 scrupulously retained, though overlooked by him. In the numerous instanccs where luter
changes cover the readings 01 the first hand, every stroke that could be traccd on repeated
examination in a strong light by the aid of glasses has been faithfully noted, but no others,
however easily they might be restored by conjecture: in one or two passages only such letters
have been printed within brackets (Foll. 186 1 303 444118). Α1111 allother manuscripts 01 the
highest antiquity, some 01 the alterations found in Codex Besae were made by the original writer (ene
evidently before he had completed the line, Mark xvi. 3), and must be held in the same estimation 11
11 they had formed part 01 his work 11011 the first: sometimes (e. g. Luke xxiv. 18) the Greek is
revised by him, while the corresponding Latin is overlooked. We 1111110 him the minute interlincar
corrections, 89 11 number (6011 the Greek, 29 11 the latin columns), thiuly scattered 01 011
printed peges, and which, as being 11 integral portion 01 the penman's task, are unrecorded in our
Adnotaticnea. They seem 10 have been lightly laid 01 with a dry pen in the oct 01 subsequent
revision, in the same firm characteres the text, and are 101 the most part easily distinguishable
from all more recent changes. Wetsteiu, indeed, who could be guided only by distant recollec-
tion (cupra p. xi), too 01111 speaks of them as by a second hand,· Kipling usually discriminatae
them correctly‚ aud whcre Ι differ from him 11 assigning tc 1 later corrector what he 111111
10 the scribe or tlte contrary, the reader 11 expressly apprised 01 the fact in the Aduotctioncs,
where my conclusion 'ns limited by such terma 11 nce judice (eg. Foll. 10419; 13012;
1481275 21913; 2001 18; 309123; 28; 3181135 31; 32512). 'l'hcy seldom indicate
any 1111111101 11 the reading, but simply amend manifest errore made in the act of transcribing,
mostly by the insertion 01 011 01 two letters, more rarely 01 whole lines or parts 01 lines
previously passed by through negligence (eg. Foll. 51 1, 52 u; 52 1, 53 0; 262 1, 263 a;
3141, 315 a). corrections 01 the slightcr kind may be seen in our Facsimilc Plate Ι, 1 17
(John xxi. 24) where υ stands over οτ 11 osor, and possibly (but not so certainly) the two dots
orer oo 11 aare 1 8, which, together with the superfluous αυ, were partially erased by a more
recent hand· A good example 01 the writer's more important changes appears in Fucoimilc
Plste III, No. l, where oc δ αν arelecta αυτην (Mark viii 35), ond the parallel Latin qui 0111
perdiderit com, at first dropped through the 01011011111161101111611μοιοτέλευτον, are interpolated
princd 110111 11 the end 01 the first line and between the first and second 01 each page. As

performing this office 101 the manuscript 01 its completior, the scribe is osten termed ὅ ἅντι-
aanor, 111 comparer.

The present seems the most fit place 101 speaking 01 1 practice 01 the original scribe
to which frequent reference is mede in our admocum. Since the ink or paint which 11⁰ used
had no metallic base, it might be almost entirely wualccd out from the vellum by a spongo
applied immediately. Although a severacum may have been made by him on a subsequent
