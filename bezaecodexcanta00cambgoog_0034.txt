review (ag. 75 al.3; 118 d 1. 43 127 0 l. 163 135 61. 13 1926133); his chief mode

61 amending fanlts 61 transcription was by means of the sponge, employed 66 early that the
gradual drying of the ink may be distinctly traced in 1116 increasing faintness 61 1116 portion
obliterated as we coma towards its end. Hence the letters (see 1166161116 Ρ1616 II, 1. ’1, 6 under 6 ’
111 diligebat), or words or whole lines which lie under tha present text, quite thickly in many

places, nearly all distinetly visible, though almost completely overlooked by my predecessors': of ‚

all these I have thought it right to render as complete an account as possible ; 1116 ceses amount
tc as many aa 231 16 611

From caresnlly observing these peculiarities, apparently so slight and insignificant, we are led
161116 interesting and valnable fact that Codex Beme, as well the Latin 66 1116 Greek peges,
scas copied from cn older model similarly 1116111611 in respect 16 tle lines or 661666. This will
plainly appear 11616 1116 multitude of places in which the words washed out came to be written
because the scribe allowed his eye to wander from the proper line 16 666 6 111116 before or after
11 5 and 61161 116166111131116611616116(6111116666661 hy reason cf the parallel lines on 1116 oppo-
site page) immediately expunged what 116 had set down in error, and substituted the proper
words in its room (aas 25362ος 256 6 15 ; 268 6 275 205 6 ll)¹. One example out of
hundreda, any 666 61 them adequate to prore the point at issue, shall be discussed at length,
11666666 11 will also incidentally shew that the peges in Codex Bezoe aad its enemplcr 6661116161
baec been identical. In Fol. 435 62 under anhelaverant ovo we cau faintly traca by the
aid 61 an eye-glans xm προσκαλεσαμενοι, 611 11111 completely wrashed 6111. These words commonce
1116 last 1166 ot' the preceding Greek page (434 11), and standing as they didon his model im-
mediately before the line he had just finisbed, the scribe heedlessly repeated thern at first, and
then canoelled them forthwith. The same appears from Foll. 89 6 32, 369611. 06 thesaure
principle we cen fully explain six several instaures of 1116 inversion 61 6661111616 lines on 1116
Iatin page, which ought to correspond with 1116 Greek, respectively noted by o, β, γ, δ (61 111
some of thern), 661 16 the margin by the first hand: they occur on Foll. 209 6; 220 6; 233 61
264 6; 276 61 504 α; 16 the second, fourth and sixth of which passages 1116 source of 1116
61161 can be distinctly traced 16 words 1116 6611116 afterwards expunged: e. g. in Fol. 2ῗο 6,
proflua-inm sanguinis now legible under tunicam rjus l. 7 was the proper ending 61 1116 1166
parallel with l. 8 61 1116 (1166115 having 6666 written it, the scribe goes cn to what is pro·
pcrly l. 0, 1161 finding out 1116 blunder as soon as he had completed l. 16, 116 111611 subjoins

be 1666116166 61616 complicated, yet just as satisfactory: in Fal. 504 6, the eye, misled by ia
