v. ll, the scribe 01 cod. D sets “mira quaedam'’ as Tregelles terme them, a story told in 28
words, τη αντη ημερα 001», which if the antithesis were bnt lees pointed, might be deemed not
wholly unworthy of the Divine Teacher¹. As it stands it is ono 01 the most interesting un-
canonical sayings imputed 10 the Lord which tradition has preserved, and is probably derived from
one 01 1110 many διηγήσεις (01111 aurviving when tho text 01 cod. D was formed) which S. Leke’e

example, a general resemblance to the parallel place of S. Matthow (xii 40), aad are supported
by c (which is οο often found in alliance with D) and, omitting the clause rpro ημερασ και rpem
νυκτασ, by a and ff' also: but e omits the whole of v. 30 up 1ο 1111000101, and together 011111ἲ

the same variation.

should rather infer from this interpolation in D (what is credible enough in itself and not
devoid of other evidence) that the 1000000 01 the 11001000 Ohuroh were settled even in that
early age when the Greek text of our manuscript was formed. Certainly it is remarkable that
cod D ahorrld read 10 Mark air. 41 απεχει το τελοσ, where τελοσ or ro τελοσ (01. D in Mark
