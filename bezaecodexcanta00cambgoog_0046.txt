Oolbert (c), Palatina (e), and Brixia (s), copies or modificatione of the elder Latin 5 and with the ,

common printed or Clementine Vulgate as amended by collation with its three best manuscripts,
Codd. Amiatinus (um), Fuldensis (fuld.) and Forojuliensis (sor.)¹. Single verses may readily be
found which might serve to shew either that d is completely independent of all other known
translations and made exclusively from the Greek on the opposite page ; or, on the contrary, that
it isa mere modificationes the Old Latin, differing no further from other copies of it than e (for
example) does from f. Τιι careful study of d in many such long passages as that here subjoined
lesda us to believe that neither of these views presente us with the whole trnth 'she Latinos
coe D was really construeted immediately from its Greek text, servilely following it (as we have
just seen) to the violation of the simplest rules of Latin syntax, and thus contains much, both in
respect to words and phrases, that is qnite peculias to itsell z while on the other hand, inasmuch
as it was the work os a Westem scribe on whose memory the diction of his native version was
lirmly imprinted, like that oi King lames' Bible is on our own, the translator nnconsoiously and
habitually imitated it, sometimes lor whole verses together, even 'in places where the Greek original
might have taught him to render otherwise. The parallel columns containing the several versione
cover pp. xxxvi, xxxvii

The general independence and occasionm conformity 01 d appear equally clear throughout
these verses Aa our attention is directed at present solely to the dictiones the several translations,
we only note in passing the remarkable identity in reading between (lodex Besae (Dd) and ι
in u. l (ιλογιζοντο δε εν sauram rso opo αποκυλισει τον utor, where yet the Latin words of 0
and dare aa far spart as they can be), in ab (οι δε sicar) and elsewhere (e. g. uu. 6, 7) ; aa also
between Del and ein a. 24 (erdopcr)¹: Dd is opposed to all the Latius in u. 5 ro προσωπα,
0. 10 in omitting ην δε. Our d will be seen to stand quite alone in u. 3 introeuntes‚· a. 4
opimiore-atur (one ol the harbarous Greek words catalogned abore) and ourictu recrescenti ,·
a. 5 timore saetae (here again from the Greek, peraptum), e. 6 numenius,- v. ll par-aurunt iu
conspeetu and derisus,· e. 1³ chaumes and iter lecticariis,⁸ e. 14 toruus, in heedleas misapprehension
of the final τουτων; u. 16 ut uon for ua; 0. 18 aduena and nesciui (to which a eomes
nearest), o. 20 paterius ,· o. 21 incipiebat (μελλων, a word similarly rendered by d in Matth.
ii. 13, and 22 other places, by coeperat Acts xvi. 27, by uolente Acts xx. 4, by liabeo Luke
x, 15 xix. 4); o. 22 seduxerunt and aututiuue (moue in 0) 3 o. 24 de ιιι qui mont naturum
and sio aaa (οιτωσ ωσ); most ol these instances being highly characteristic. Just aa visible,
however, is the resemblance between d and some or all of its fellows: in 0. 23 it approaches
very close to a, and hes with it simun 0. 53 stadios o. 13: in e. 9 τοισ etam is rendered illis
ιηᾱιιίπι by all except c, with which alone d has reliquis v. 9: iu o. 13 κωμην is cosmidum, in
o. 15 opalus is fabulari (neither of them very happy translations) in all but u, as d rendere
ομειλησασ in Acts xx. 11 and with tce has fistulaturuur here in o. ll, though s and the
Vulgata rightly change it into loquebantur: in u. 16 all save e enrploy tenebamur (detinebuntur, e).
Above all, there occurs sometimes for verses together (e. g. uu. l, 8) such a similamty in the tone
and rhythm of the sentences as cannot be deemed accidenta13 yet may perhaps ιι sufficiently
aecounted for on the part ol' the scnbe called d by imperfect recollectione of the primitive
Iatin version still fondly eherished in his mind.

¹ An necessary iniorrnation respecting thess MSS. various readings lull oi interest: e. g. in u. ryet ederunt
will be found in Seivaner's Ploiu Intmd. pipam-269, tristes, with n A p. m. B. Besldes a. ²⁴ kirchendorf
and in Mr Westeott's noble article on the Latin versione (Cori. Pelet. Proleg. p. xviii) cites John x. 3 ; xvii. 11 ;
in Smith's marmure os tte situ. Luke xxiii. oph xxiv. ⁴9 aa passages where Dand e agree
¹ The version in e isoiten very rude and free, and its against all others.
