INTRODUCTION.

Μ

Trrn Greek and [retia manuscript ol the Four Gospels and Actaei the Apostles, generally known
as the Codex Beaae or Codex D, may seem somewhat less ancient than three or four other extant
copias ol the New Testament, but in respect to the modification ol the inspired text which it exhibits

¹ ia perhaps more interesting and remarkable than any other document of its elaea It is now the

property of the University ol Cambridge, in whose public Library the open volume is conspicuous
to vinitore (Nn. 11. 41) ; and the Syndics ol the University Press have liberally contributed tc defray
the eost of the present work, in which the parallel lines os the Greek original and its latin version
(which in Codex Beaae itsell are written on separate peges in aecio( characters) are' represented on
the same pege in carsiae or ordinary letters (pp. 1-415), precisely ss they were rea by the first
scribe, nine leaves supplied by later hands being banished to an Appendix, and printed in smaller
type (pp. 417-428). Το this edition ol the text (which it is hoped will be found ae exact aa
anxious care could make it) is annexed a Commentary or body ol notes, wherein the many changes
brought into its primitive readings by subsequent correctore (pp. 429-448), all liturgica] marks
(pp. 448-450) and other foreign matter (pp. 451-2) soattered throughout the margin ol the book,
are diligently recorded, and their respective dates, so far· as may be, ascertained. The three socaimile
pagee in lithogreph are‘designed to illustrate this Introduction, whose purpose is todiscuss, briefly
yet not too superficially, (l) the recent history cl the manuscript and the several collatioris of it

already executed: (2) its palaeographioal appearance, probable origin, arrd age: (3) the characteres
its Latin translation, and (4) ol its Greek text, as critically examined, arrd compared with other

monuments of sacred arrtiquity, whether manuscripts, versione, or citatione of Scriptura by early
Fathers ol the Charch.

CHAPTER Ι.

ON THE RECENT HISTORY OF OODEX BEZAR

Trrrr letter of Theodora Beza (dated 6 December, 1581) which accompenied the manuscript, hia
munificent gift to the University ol Cambridge, and the reply of the Vico-Chaucellor· and Senate (dated
18 May, laea, but not yet received by Boas aelate aa October 1582, il ever) are reprinted on the
opposite page ¹. The larigusge olthe latter, extravagantes it is, only too faithfully expresses the vene-
ration ol that learned body sor the donor and his master Calvin, which already boded so ill lor the
peace of the English Church. To the French Reformer’s meagre account ol his manuscript, that he
had gotten it some years before from the Monastery of S. henaena at Lyorrs, must be added a more
