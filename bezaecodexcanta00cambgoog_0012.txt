TO THE RIGHT REVEREND

EDWARD HAROLD, LORD BISHOP OF ELY.

Mr Lonn,

Wnrrv I first projected a new Edition of Codex Bezae, you were so
good as to recommend my design to the Syndics of the Cambridge Pressas
one worthy of aid from the funds at their disposal; you have encouraged me
throughout my task with kind interest and ready sympathy: yet I am so
deeply conscious of the laults of this Volume that Ι should be ashamed to
inscribe it to your Lordship had I not unsparingly devoted to it time and
pains and the best faculties of my mind. My work, indeed, bas proved far
harder than I expected, but its diligent prosecution has brought with it such
real delight that Ι cannot part from the companion of many laborious hours

without some loving regret, not unmingled (I would trust) with revereat
thankfulness that life and heart have been vouchsafed to me to make one poor
contribution more to the critical study of Holy Scripture.

My Lord, may it pleaso Him whose Providenoe has called you to your
high office to prosper therein all that your hand findeth to do: may His
blessing especially rest on your godly endeavour to restore to our dear Cambridge
her ancient glory of being the school aud home of true divinity, by persuading
her most promising sons to consecrate their fresh strength to the ministry of
Christ’s Church in England, at this time of no common need.

’ Ι am, my Lonn,
Your obliged and dutiful servant,
F. H. SCRIVENER.

S. (immo, June l, 1864.
