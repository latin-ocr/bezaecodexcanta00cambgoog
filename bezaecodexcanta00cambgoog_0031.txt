, teat in both languages is broken up into certain paragraphs of very nnequal length, such as we meet

with no where else, each commencing in a letter (sometimes but not usually larger than the rest)
which encroaches a little on the margin, and is clearly indicated throughout our edition (see also
Facsimile Platea Ι and ΙΙ, 1. 2); Bp. Marah 0011010153 (Ι reckon but 11810111 in the Greek and
Latin) such peragmpbs in S. Mark’s Gospel¹. The Ammonian sections, however, without the Euse-
bian canons², are inserted in the side margin 01 Codex Besae by a scribe whom we shall 1101011101
(infra p. xxvii) shew to have lived several centuries later than this manuscript was written, and the
beginning ο1 each section is indicated hy double points interpolated in the body of the text before
or (if space be wanting) ovar its first letter, very often in both places, referring to similar double
points placed in the margin after the Ammonian numerals'. The single point by the first hand
precedes these latter double points in Fol. 92 611 e, 10, 224 b l. 16, and follows them Fol. 311 1 ΞΟ.
While banishing to our detractationes all other matter found in 1110 margin (infra pp. ets-452),
oven that written by the same 11111111 as the sections, convenience or necessity bave led us to retain
these and the corresponding points, which we must once for all request the reader to regard as
much more recent than any other writing on the page. The variatione in place and number of these
sections from those commonly found in manuscripts and editions are recorded iu our work (infra
p. 453), as they are somewhat enricus and interesting ; it is also remarkable 111111 as in Codex Sinai·
ticos (where they censa in S. Lnke 11101 ch. ix. 57), they are not eomicd 011 comp-leta throughout
the Gospels This arises at the 01111 01 S. Matthew (where the last section noted is τνβ, ch. xxvii. 62)

and the beginning 01 S. John (i. 1-15)1157 reason of the sido margins 0111011. loa-4 being cut ·

clean away; but this explanation does not hold for the end 0181101111 (xx. 13-11111.25), 0101 S.
lllnrk, where tho sections terminate at Ji, ch. xv. 16.

Μο10 recent than the Ammoniou numerals and points are the nine leaves supplied in their proper
places as Codex Bezae is now bound, but in this edition exiled to an Appendix (pp. 417-428), and
printed in smaller type than the rest of the volume. The first 01 these additional leaves contains
Matth. ii. 21-1117 Latin, iii. 7 -16 Greek: the next seven have crowded into them the contenta
of the eight lost leaves which originally formed 001101010022 (supro p. xiv), via John xviii. 2-
xa 1 Latia, 111111.14-1111. 13 Greek: the ninth leaf has on the first page Mark xvi. 6-15 Latia,
on its second page in parallel columns the Greek and Latin of Mark xvi 15-20 and (the Greek in
blue inlr) the subscriptione proper to each. All these Latin peges are transcribed from copies of the
Vulgata which resembled the Clementiae printed edition more closely than do Cod. Amiatinns

and the best manuscripts (e. g. John xviii. 12 ; 16 ; 19 ; 31 ; 36 101,- xix. 6 ; 16 ; 24 ; 28 ; 36), and

graphs may bc, hir Hanaell did right in retaining them
in his tens of the oldest aciatinp marrmmipts of the N. Τ.
(0110111, 1861), 11 is worth notice that, as in Codd. Si·
nsiticus and Vaticanus, each Bestitude in Matth v. 1011111
a separate paragraph.

⁹ These nmnernls are so set 1111101110 placee(e.g. Foll.
34, 91, 9²» ¹²7. 163, 335, ,1591) as to leave nc reem tor
tha Eusebiae canons to be placed under 1110111, 10 that the
latter could not have been deaigned to bs subsequently
added. Many other copies hsve the sections without the
canons which we might have deemed essential tc their
completeness: e. g. Evan. Oodd. cFHIPQawaz.

in Evae. E, which contains the canons hesidas3 and
Tiscbendorf has just informed mc that it dso appears in
the six leaves of 1110111, 01 1110 aiath century (much
